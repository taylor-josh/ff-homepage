## A Simple Startpage Built to enhance my Firefox Experience##

Recently, the new tab page in Firefox has not been doing it for me so I whipped
up this small page to display the date and time instead. I typically will change
the coloring for this page to reflect my current system colorscheme
(a modified Base16-tomorrow night with bolder colors).

You can find my FireFox CSS right [here](https://gist.github.com/source-decay/e6fec3c3bbbdd06476b15dd4f35ddcb3)
